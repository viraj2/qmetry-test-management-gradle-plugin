# qmetry-test-management-gradle-plugin
QMetry Test Management plugin for Gradle has been designed to seamlessly integrate your CI/CD pipeline with QMetry.

QTMGradlePlugin uploads result file(s) generated in a Gradle project to QTM Enterprise server.
The plugin, if used in a gradle project, provides an additional gradle task 'publishResults'

# How to use the plugin?
'gradle clean install' - to install the plugin in your local maven repository. 
Use the plugin from anywhere in your gradle project, by including the following code in 'build.gradle' file...

apply plugin: 'com.qmetry.qtmgradleplugin'

qmetryConfig
{
	qtmUrl='https://yourcompany.qmetry.com/'
	qtmAutomationApiKey='zEzs7iy77D8ARWX8xMFzdhfsrgh6W0LCyaK6xdec'
	automationFramework='JUNIT'
	testResultFilePath='/test-results/test/TEST-ispl.sample.AppSecondTest.xml'
	platform='chrome'
	testSuite='STR-TS-01'
	buildName='Default Cycle'
}

buildscript
{
    repositories
	{
        mavenLocal()
		mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies
	{
        classpath 'com.qmetry:QTMGradlePlugin:1.0'
    }
}

use command 'gradle test publishResults' from your project.

...or alternatively, use the executable jar file (generated by command 'gradle clean build') directly as a dependency in your Gradle project 'build.gradle' file.

The task publishResults always looks for qmetryConfig in build.gradle file of your project. Provide following details :-

qtmUrl - url to qtm instance
qtmAutomationApiKey - Automation Key
automationFramework - JUNIT/TESTNG/CUCUMBER/QAS/HPUFT
testSuite (optional) - Key of test suite.
buildName (optional) - Name of cycle linked to test suite
testResultFilePath - path to result file (or directory for multiple files) relative to build directory
platform(optional) - Name of the platform to connect the suite
